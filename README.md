This repository is aimed for those who are newbies to Asterisk's new SIP stack named PJSIP (res_pjsip).

A high-level view of PJSIP objects could help you more quickly understand the stack.

The diagram was created based on information from:
- pjsip.conf sample file
- `config show help res_pjsip` CLI commands
- https://wiki.asterisk.org
